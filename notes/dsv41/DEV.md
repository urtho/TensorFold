# Dev loop: DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash at TP=2 (aiai rank 0, aiai2 rank 1)

`tools/dsv41_run2.sh ARGS` rsyncs this checkout to `~/tensorfold` on both nodes and runs
`tools/dsv41_serial_run.py` in `tf-dev` (repo at `/tf`) on both ranks. A run's fixed cost is the weight load
(~82 s from the checkpoint, ~24 s from a prepared folder) plus graph capture and warm-up; the suites below pay it once
a group instead of once a test.

## Suites and tiers

    tools/dsv41_suite2.sh quick                 # engine smoke at short context: 2 processes
    tools/dsv41_suite2.sh full                  # quick + long context and quality: 3 processes
    tools/dsv41_suite2.sh long                  # the long-context group alone
    tools/dsv41_suite2.sh step-test,resume-test # named tests (their groups)
    python3 tools/dsv41_suite.py fresh full     # every test as a single dsv41_run2.sh command

A test is one of dsv41_serial_run.py's modes with fixed arguments (`tools/dsv41_suite.py`, `TESTS`). Tests that need
the same construction share a group: one process, one weight load, and `fresh_state` between tests (every cache, ring
and staging ring zeroed in place, each slot back on its construction extent with no tokens, no kept states or bank,
the drafter's rings clear, the torch seed and peak stats reset; the decode graphs stay, as captured at start).

| group | construction | tests |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | `--cap 16384 --slots 2 --graph --dspark 3` | multi-test (24 steps), step-test (8000 tokens, drafted rounds), resume-test (3000,600), views-test (3000), chunk-prefill (`TF_CHUNK_PREFILL=1 --chunk-test 6000,1000,3000,4500`) |
| `fp8` | the same, `TF_DSV41_KV=fp8` (read at import: its own process) | fp8-multi-test, fp8-resume-test (identity spot checks of the fp8 caches) |
| `long` | `--cap 140000 --slots 1 --graph` | decode-bench (32K, 128K), needle (32K, 128K at 10/50/90%), tf-compare (32K, 96K), prefill-bench (8K, 64K) |

Tiers: **quick** = `q` + `fp8`; **full** = quick + `long`. Each test prints
`[result] NAME PASS|FAIL|INFO|WARN|ERROR fp=<fingerprint> <seconds>s <summary>`; a group ends with a `[suite]` line
(rank 1 prints the same into its log, `~/tensorfold/serial-r1.log` on aiai2), `dsv41_suite2.sh` merges the groups
into `out/suite-<stamp>/summary.txt` and exits 1 on a FAIL or an ERROR. A test that raises (an OOM under the
allocator cap included) is an ERROR and stops its group: the ranks may be out of step after it.

PASS means: batched == alone and the verify window rows match (multi-test); whole == chunked == drafted (step-test);
COPY, NVMe bytes and TAKEOVER resumes == fresh (resume-test); every kept view equal on both ranks (views-test); last-row
logits bit-equal for every split (chunk-prefill); every needle recalled. decode-bench and prefill-bench report (INFO);
tf-compare reports, and with `--suite-baseline /tf/out/<an earlier suite-...-long.json>` FAILs when a document with
the same tokens loses more than 0.01 NLL or 1 point of top-1 (decode-bench: WARN when 10% slower). The markdown and
code documents are this tree's own files, so only unchanged ones are compared; the golden document always is.

### When quick suffices, when the long tier is required

- **quick** for changes that keep every long-context path as it was: the decode step, verify / drafted rounds, slot and
  extent handling, kept states, tools and serving code, kernels whose inputs are short (<= 16K positions).
- **full** (the long tier) for anything touching long-context paths: KV formats and their quantization (fp4 / fp8 /
  bf16, `TF_DSV41_KV*`, `IQ_FP4`, `SWA_FP8`, `COMP_BF16`), the indexer and top-k selection (`topk.py`, `FAST_TOPK`,
  tie keys, widths), compressed-entry pools and the shared pool, prefill (chunk plans, the bounded tail, Engram reads
  in prompt chunks), attention kernels (`mqa_fp4`, Triton MQA), and before a deploy. Run the long tier on the
  parent first: every `dsv41_suite2.sh` run writes `/tf/out/suite-<stamp>-<group>.json` on aiai (copied to
  `out/suite-<stamp>/`); then run the changed tree with `--suite-baseline /tf/out/suite-<stamp>-long.json`.

### A test in a suite equals the same test in a fresh process

A suite test parses the very argument list its fresh run gets (`Test.argv`: the group's construction, then the mode),
and a fresh run whose flags and mode environment are a suite test's prints the suite name in its `[result]` line. The
fingerprint covers the deterministic outputs only (tokens, logits diffs, view hashes, NLL values; never timings), so

    TF_SUITE_PROVE=1 tools/dsv41_suite2.sh quick

runs the tier, then every test again in its own process, and `python3 tools/dsv41_suite.py prove` checks that each
fresh run printed the suite's fingerprint (`out/suite-<stamp>/prove.txt`).

### Measured (2026-10-05, merged dsv41-cuda)

| what | wall |
|---|---|
| quick tier as one-load suites (`q` + `fp8`, prepared folders) | **168 s** end to end (2 processes; weights 22-24 s each) |
| the same 7 tests as fresh invocations, prepared folders | 370 s (48-62 s each) |
| the same 7 tests as fresh invocations from the checkpoint (the old loop) | 499 s (62-81 s each; weights ~41 s with a warm page cache, ~82 s cold) |
| quick tier as one-load suites from the checkpoint (`TF_DSV41_PREPARED=`) | 202 s |

`TF_SUITE_PROVE=1 tools/dsv41_suite2.sh quick`: every fingerprint equal in the suite and in a fresh process (7/7), and
equal from the prepared folders and from the checkpoint. chunk-prefill's fingerprint holds the whole prefill's
last-row logits (sha256 of the bytes), the others the decoded tokens / view hashes.

## Measurement mode: single requests as the server runs them

    TF_COMM=rdma TF_ROUND_PROF=1 TF_DECODE_ROWS=1,2,4 tools/dsv41_run2.sh --cap 131072 --slots 2 --dspark 5 --graph \
      --decode-bench 2048 --jaybench code,prose,structured,c1 [--jb-serial] [--jb-carry] [--jb-reps 3]

`--jaybench` sends each workload as one request through `MultiDecoder` (the server's decoder at `PARALLEL` > 1: admit,
rounds until done, finish; rank 1 follows), after one warm-up, `--jb-reps` times: code / prose / structured are
jayleaton's m2bench prompts (greedy, thinking off, chat template, 384 tokens), c1 / hard bench_decode's C1 and C1hard
prompts with a fixed nonce (T 0.2, top-k 20, top-p 0.95, 2048 tokens). Each line: the median first-to-last-token tok/s
(as `out/jaybench/jaybench.py` measures over HTTP), rounds, tokens and rows verified a round, drafts proposed /
accepted and the reply's token sha; `--jb-serial` decodes each workload once more without drafts and checks the sha.
The draft policy's running estimate is reset before every request, so identical requests plan identical rounds in one
process (the cost curves are timed at start: two processes can differ by a few rounds); `--jb-carry` keeps it across
requests as `TF_DSV41_DRAFT_RESET=0` would. `--cap 131072` keeps the server's 65536-key narrow graphs in play, `--dspark
5` its draft count, `TF_COMM=rdma` its all-gathers. With `--decode-bench 2048` and `TF_DECODE_ROWS` the window costs
(1 / 2 / 4 rows) and the drafter graph come first, in the same process.

`TF_ROUND_PROF=1` adds the round split (`multi.RoundSplit`, rank 0): host ms for plan, send (the ROUND message to rank 1),
draft (the drafting pass with its sync), hash / gather0 / gather1 (Engram hashes, the table reads while the window
runs), wait (for the window's end), post; GPU ms of the window graph and the drafting pass (CUDA events); the window by
verified rows. Measured 2026-10-06 (the draft policy below, no L2 prefetch):

| workload | round | window GPU | draft GPU | host + sync | tokens a round | rows a round |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| code | 51.2 ms | 45.6 | 5.1 | 0.5 (send 0.37) | 4.04 | 5.4 |
| prose | 36.8 ms | 33.0 | 3.4 (4.9 in drafting rounds) | 0.5 (send 0.31) | 1.58 | 2.5 |
| structured | 51.4 ms | 45.7 | 5.1 | 0.6 (send 0.44) | 5.91 | 5.9 |

The window graph is ~89% of a round, the drafter ~10%, host and sync ~1%. Windows at 2048 tokens: 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 rows
25.2 / 29.9 / 37.9 / 48.5 ms; drafter graph 5.1 ms.

Draft policy (`multi.py`): each request's acceptance estimates start at `TF_DSV41_DRAFT_PRIOR` (0.8), and a stream that
stopped drafting drifts back toward it (`TF_DSV41_DRAFT_RELAX`, 0.02 a round without drafts: its estimates only move in
drafted rounds, so before this a stream that stopped never drafted again). `TF_DSV41_DRAFT_RESET=0` carries the running
estimate across requests (the old behaviour in full: also `TF_DSV41_DRAFT_RELAX=0 TF_DSV41_DRAFT_PRIOR=0.6`). Single requests: old start (0.6, carried) code 76.9-78.0, prose 39.8-41.5,
structured 109.1-114.1, c1 98.7-99.3, hard 38.8; now 77.3-79.8 / 42.3 / 114.0 / 99.5, hard 47.4.

L2 prefetch (`serial.py`, default `TF_L2_PREFETCH=bulk`, paced at `TF_L2_PACE_GBPS=150` through `l2pace.cu`, all three
sites, joined at the step's end; `TF_L2_PREFETCH=0` off, `TF_L2_SITES`, `TF_L2_PACE_CTAS`, `TF_L2_PACE_DELAY_US`,
`TF_L2_PACE_SITES`, `TF_L2_JOIN=use|end`): 1 / 2 / 4-row windows 25.2 / 29.9 / 37.9 -> 24.1 / 28.5 / 36.5 ms;
unpaced, each site alone, in pairs or together: within 0.4 ms of off.

## Prepared weights in dev runs

The compose server's `make prepare` writes each rank's built weights to `PREPARED_DIR`
(`/home/urtho/.cache/tensorfold-prepared`, ~99 GB a node). A dev run reads them when

1. tf-dev mounts that directory at `/prepared` (`dsv41_run2.sh` checks both nodes and sets `TF_DSV41_PREPARED=/prepared`;
   `TF_DSV41_PREPARED=` builds from the checkpoint), and
2. the folder's key matches: the checkpoint files (same `/models` mount), rank and world, torch's version and the GPU
   (tf-dev and the image share `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.07-py3`), the knobs `TF_FOLD_SHARED` / `TF_GROUPED_WO_A`
   (empty in both), whether the DSpark blocks are in, and the source of the code that builds the weights
   (`fastboot.CODE`: weights.py, reader.py, split.py, config.py, exl3 format / linear / experts, direct_read). Changes to
   serial.py, kernels.py, dspark.py and the rest do not touch it. `make prepare` builds with the DSpark blocks, so
   `--draft-weights auto` (the default) loads them whenever that folder is current, with or without `--dspark`; the
   engine ignores them until `enable_dspark`.

A key miss is not an error: the run builds from the checkpoint as before and says why (`key differs (code)`). Nothing in
a dev run writes a folder: aiai's disk holds one (79 GB free beside a 99 GB folder on 2026-10-05), and `make prepare`
prunes the old one first. tf-dev on aiai and aiai2 was recreated with the mount on 2026-10-05 (old containers kept stopped as
`tf-dev-old-<stamp>`, deletable; the new tf-dev runs ON the image `tf-dev-snapshot:<stamp>`, its old layer with the
editable install of /tf, so keep that image). To recreate tf-dev with the mount (once a node, both nodes):

    python3 tools/dsv41_tfdev_recreate.py aiai            # dry run: docker inspect saved to out/, commands printed
    python3 tools/dsv41_tfdev_recreate.py aiai --apply    # commit, rename + stop the old one, run the new one, check

It refuses while anything but `sleep infinity` runs in tf-dev, keeps the container layer (`docker commit`: the
editable install of `/tf`) and the old container (stopped, as `tf-dev-old-<stamp>`), and rolls back when the new one
cannot import tensorfold or see `/prepared`.

## OOM guard

GB10's GPU allocations are the host's memory; an OOM in a dev run has rebooted aiai three times (the host watchdog).
Three layers, defaults keeping >= 3 GiB available:

1. **Refuse to start** when MemAvailable is under `TF_MEM_MIN_START_GIB` (100; a rank's weights are ~99 GiB): another
   job holds the memory.
2. **Allocator cap** (`tools/dsv41_memguard.py`): `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction` at MemAvailable less
   `TF_MEM_RESERVE_GIB` (3) and `TF_MEM_SLACK_GIB` (3: CUDA context, NCCL, ~40 MB of driver memory a decode graph,
   pinned staging), so torch raises `OutOfMemoryError` in the process instead of exhausting the node.
   `TF_MEM_CAP_GIB=N` sets it, `0` turns it off. Long runs near the edge (600K contexts) may need a smaller slack.
3. **Watcher** (`tools/dsv41_memwatch.sh`): `dsv41_run2.sh` starts one inside tf-dev on each node (`docker exec -d`,
   same PID namespace and user as the run) for this run's tag (`--run-tag`); it reads MemAvailable every 0.25 s and
   SIGKILLs only that run's processes below `TF_MEMWATCH_GIB` (3; `0`: no watcher), logging a `KILL` line to
   `~/tensorfold/memwatch.log` that run2.sh prints. It exits with the run (and run2.sh stops it on exit or Ctrl-C,
   killing a rank of the run still there 15 s after the other ended).

**Expandable segments by default**: `dsv41_run2.sh` runs both ranks with
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`, as the compose server does, unless the caller sets
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` (set and empty: torch's default allocator). The guard's math is unchanged: the cap bounds
torch's reserved bytes in either mode (with expandable segments a tensor reserves in 20 MiB pages, 1 GiB -> 1040 MiB,
and an allocation past the cap still raises `OutOfMemoryError`; checked in tf-dev at a 4 GiB cap), and the slack
covers the same allocations outside the allocator. 2026-10-05: the quick tier passes with the same 7 fingerprints as
with `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=` (lowest MemAvailable during the tier 9.9 GiB on both nodes, cap 110.7 GiB).

`docker update --memory` on tf-dev is not used: GB10 GPU allocations are not charged to the container's cgroup
(2026-10-05: tf-dev's `memory.current` 6.9 GB, `anon` 2.2 GB, while its rank held 108,893 MiB per nvidia-smi), so it
would bound only host-side memory and could OOM-kill a run on page cache.

## Quality across KV formats

Teacher-forced over a wider document set (`--tf-docs wide`: the base set plus markdown windows at 1/3 and 2/3 of the
markdown corpus, all three code windows, and the first L tokens of each `--tf-prose` text; `tf_documents` in
`dsv41_serial_run.py`), once per format, each in prompt chunks and in 32-row calls (`--tf-rows 32`: the decode / verify
attention and the shared-tile indexer):

    for kv in fp4 fp8 bf16; do for rows in "" "--tf-rows 32"; do
      TF_MEM_SLACK_GIB=4 TF_DSV41_KV=$kv tools/dsv41_run2.sh \
        --cap 70000 --slots 1 --graph --tf-compare 8192,32768,65536 --tf-docs wide \
        --tf-prose /tf/out/prose/pg155.txt,/tf/out/prose/pg145.txt $rows --out /tf/out/tf-$kv${rows:+-rows}.pt
    done; done
    python3 tools/dsv41_tf_compare.py tf-bf16.pt tf-fp4.pt tf-fp8.pt    # per document, clustered SEs per length

The prose texts are Project Gutenberg #155 (The Moonstone) and #145 (Middlemarch), copied to `~/tensorfold/out/prose/`
on aiai (the header and footer are cut). 26 documents (9 at 8K and 32K, 8 at 64K), 2,047 scored positions each.
Without `expandable_segments` the prepared-weights load leaves ~4.7 GiB reserved but unusable, and a 64K document
then either OOMs under a lower allocator cap or crosses the 3 GiB floor (the watcher kills it); the server and
`dsv41_run2.sh` (the OOM guard, below) set it.

Paired MMLU against the compose server (`tools/dsv41_mmlu.py`: 40 seeded questions from each of the 57 subjects, 0-shot,
thinking off, greedy, the first standalone A-D letter; exact McNemar on the discordant pairs):

    python3 tools/dsv41_mmlu.py sample --test mmlu_test.jsonl --per-subject 40 --seed 0 --out sample.jsonl
    TF_API_KEY=... python3 tools/dsv41_mmlu.py run --sample sample.jsonl --out fp4.jsonl     # then the other format
    python3 tools/dsv41_mmlu.py compare fp8.jsonl fp4.jsonl --labels fp8,fp4

Measured 2026-10-05 (f2fe699): teacher-forced top-1 agreement with bf16 fp4 96.75% / 96.80% (chunks / rows), fp8
97.69% / 97.68%, the same format through the two paths 98.25% (bf16), 97.62% (fp4); dNLL fp4 +0.0012 / +0.0008
(document-clustered SE 0.0005 / 0.0008), fp8 +0.0000; no document beyond 3 SD. MMLU (2,280 questions) fp4 85.75%,
fp8 86.23%, McNemar b=25 c=14 p=0.11; fp4 starts reasoning instead of a letter more often (17 vs 3 questions).

## Serving the current source from the compose deployment

`make hot` in `deploy/dsv41-tp2` (see its README) serves `SRC`'s current `src/` without `make image`; `make cold`
returns to the image. Kernel (`.cu`) changes still compile once on the first start after them (in `prebuild`).
