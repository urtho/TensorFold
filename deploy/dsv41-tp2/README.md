# tensorfold-dsv41-TP2

TensorFold serving DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash EXL3 2.9bpw at TP=2 across two DGX Sparks, as a docker-compose project.
It is a drop-in for the vLLM recipe (`../deepseek41flash-exl3-TP2`): same port (8888), same model id
(`DeepSeek-v4.1-Flash-EXL3`) and the same bearer API key, so clients and the frpc tunnel need no change.
The two cannot run at once (each takes ~100 GiB a rank, both bind :8888); `make swap-in` / `make swap-out`.

| file | |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | NGC PyTorch 26.07 + xgrammar / transformers + a snapshot of the TensorFold source (`build/tensorfold`) |
| `docker-compose.yaml` | one service for both ranks; `rank0.env` (head) / `rank1.env` (worker) set the rank and its NICs |
| `docker-compose.hot.yaml` | `make hot` only: the synced source over the image's (below) |
| `.env` | shared settings: paths, port, model id, API key, `PARALLEL`, `CONTEXT` (from `.env.example`, chmod 600) |
| `Makefile` | runs on the head; mirrors this directory to the worker (`WORKER=aiai2-ib`) at the same path |

## Use

    make env          # first time: .env from .env.example, then set TF_API_KEY
    make image        # snapshot SRC (/home/urtho/tensorfold), build tensorfold-dsv41:<rev> + :latest on both nodes
    make swap-in      # vLLM down, then `make up`
    make status / logs / logs-worker / smoke
    make swap-out     # TensorFold down, vLLM up

`make up` refuses while vLLM, a dev run in `tf-dev`, or anything else holds the GPUs or :8888, while the house
memory watchdog is armed, or (with the carveout) while `nvidia_drm` modeset is off. It drops caches, waits
for `MEM_READY_GIB` free on both nodes, checks that every RoCE device has a RoCE v2 IPv4 GID (and
logs its index), starts the worker, then the head, and waits for `/health`. Nothing pins the GID index: the
index moves (a peer's reboot can leave aiai2's `roceP2p1s0f1` at 4 while `rocep1s0f1` stays at 3), so NCCL picks
it per device (`NCCL_IB_ROCE_VERSION_NUM=2`, `NCCL_IB_ADDR_FAMILY=AF_INET`, `NCCL_IB_ADDR_RANGE` 10.42.0.0/15) and
the RoCE all-gather finds it by type and address (`TF_RDMA_GID_INDEX` pins it).

The containers are not restarted on their own: one rank coming back alone would wait at rendezvous for a peer
that is not coming. Start and stop both with `make`.

## Kept prompts on NVMe

With `TF_DSV41_DISK=/kvdisk` (and `KV_DISK_DIR`, node-local NVMe, on both nodes; see `.env.example`) a kept prompt
state the shared pool evicts is written to disk (both ranks, in step) and restored into the pool when a later prompt
resumes from it: a read of ~45 MB for 32K tokens (fp4 KV; ~75 MB in fp8) instead of half a minute of prefill. `make down` ends the live
streams and writes every kept state first (`STOP_GRACE_S`, 150 s when the tier is on); the next start keeps the
entries both ranks hold. Entries live in a directory named by a hash of the build (source, model files, knobs,
libraries, device): a new image starts empty, and the old directories can be deleted. `TF_DSV41_DISK_GIB` (128)
bounds the space, least recently used first; `TF_DSV41_DISK_MIN` (2048) is the smallest state written;
`TF_DSV41_DISK_STAGE_MIB` (1024) of pinned memory a rank stage the copies. `/models` may share the NVMe (Engram reads).

## Loop guard, late kernel loads

`TF_LOOP_GUARD=1` (`.env`) makes the loop guard the server default: a thinking reply whose last three windows of 1,024
tokens each held under 2% new token 8-grams has its thinking closed (`\n</think>\n\n` after the window), and the reply
goes on to its answer; the log says `loop guard: ...` and the reply's stats carry `"loop_guard": true`. A request's
`"loop_guard": true / false` overrides the default; replies under a grammar or a `thinking_budget` are never cut.

After the start-up warm-ups (the serving-path one sends prompts of 1-32 rows, odd and 16-multiple tails, a resumed kept
prompt and concurrent streams through the decoder) any Triton kernel loaded for the first time is printed
(`late kernel load ...`) and counted in `/health` (`late_kernel_loads`): such a load mid-serving once failed with CUDA
800 in a peer engine. A count above zero names a shape the warm-up should cover.

The serving-path battery is `TF_DSV41_WARM_SERVING` (`.env`): empty / `full` the 13 waves (~19.9K prompt tokens,
27-54 s), `trim` three waves (~2.8K tokens: a 2600-token prompt kept at 2048 and its end, a sampled 100-token prompt
decoding while that prompt resumes with 48 more, a 7-token prompt), `audit` trim then full from a clean pool, printing
`[warm-trace] audit: N kernels only the full battery loads`, `0` none. `TF_DSV41_WARM_RARE=1` (empty: on under
trim / audit) also loads two prompt-chunk shapes no warm-up prompt reaches: an indexer key segment of one key and the
packed-FP4 attention past `TF_DSV41_FULL_DEQ_MIB` (ratio-1 layers past 128K). `TF_DSV41_WARM_TRACE=1` prints the
Triton kernels each startup stage and wave loaded first, their seconds, and the serving warm-up's set with a digest: a
full boot and a trim boot loading the same set print the same digest. Before making trim the default: an audit boot
with 0 misses, then `late_kernel_loads` 0 after a soak, a stress run and a long run past 128K. None of these switches
enters the calibration or NVMe-tier keys.

## Watchdog

`watchdog.sh` checks the pair once a minute from a systemd user timer (`make watch-install`; the user must linger
for it to run at boot). A tick is bad when a container is not running, `/health` is not 200 (`TF_HEALTH=strict`
answers 503 for a fatal engine or one engine call running longer than `TF_STALL_S`), or a 1-token probe sent
every 10 minutes while idle fails. After `WATCH_FAILS` bad ticks (a dead container counts 2) it saves both ranks'
logs and, with `WATCH_HEAL=1`, runs `make restart` in the background, at most once every `WATCH_MIN_HEAL` seconds;
`WATCH_HEAL=0` (the default until the cluster tests below pass) only alerts. It stands down while:

- `make lease` is unexpired (`LEASE_MIN`, default 20 minutes; benchmarks take one),
- an `up` / `down` / `restart` holds the lock (`~/.local/state/tensorfold-dsv41/lock`),
- both containers are absent after a deliberate `make down` (the stop marker holds across reboots; `make up` clears it),
- vLLM runs on either node, or the head container is still loading (younger than `WATCH_GRACE`, 1800 s).

Both containers absent without the marker (a reboot while serving) is a bad tick: the watchdog then starts the
pair. `make watch-status` shows the timer, the counters and the last log lines; state and logs are in
`~/.local/state/tensorfold-dsv41/`.

Before setting `WATCH_HEAL=1`: check that `make up` runs from the unit (no TTY: `sudo -n` for `guard` / `memwait`
and `ssh -o BatchMode=yes aiai2-ib true` must work), then on the pair: `docker kill` the worker (healed within
~2 min); `kill -STOP` rank 1's python (`/health` still answers, `stalled` turns true, healed); `make down` and a
reboot (stands down); `make lease && make soak` (no heal); two failures within 30 minutes (the second only alerts);
the house mem-watchdog armed during a heal (the `guard` failure lands in `heal.log` and alerts).

## Bench

`make soak [MINUTES=30]`, `make stress` and `make structured` run `tools/dsv41_soak.py`, `dsv41_stress.py` and
`dsv41_structured.py` from `SRC` against the endpoint, with the API key in their environment (never on a command
line), after a watchdog lease covering the run; reports go to `results/`. The soak passes with no errors, the server
drained at the end, the 17×23 sanity answer (391), no fatal `/health`, and one `token_sha` for every repeated greedy
request. `structured --suites schemas,tools` needs `TF_DSV41_TOOL_GRAMMAR=required` on the server.

## Timings (2026-10-02)

- first start after an image build with an empty cache: 5m39s (CUDA extensions build into `CACHE_DIR`)
- later starts: 2m22s from `make restart` to serving (83 s load + warm-up and graph capture)
- `PARALLEL=8 CONTEXT=131072`: 6.9 GiB left after warm-up, 3.0 GiB of kept prompt states;
  8 clients 85 tok/s aggregate, concurrent replies identical to sequential ones

## JIT caches (2026-10-06)

Triton keeps compiled kernels in `~/.triton/cache` and the driver its PTX JIT output in `~/.nv/ComputeCache` by
default: inside the container layer, which every `make up` / `make restart` recreates (`--force-recreate`), so each
start compiled ~84 Triton kernels during graph capture and warm-up, and ~12 more mid-serving (the prompt indexer's
`_index_scores_seg_rows` specializations on the first 8K and 100K prompts: the first PP8192 trial 1390-1550 tok/s
instead of ~1650). The image now sets `TRITON_CACHE_DIR=/root/.cache/triton` and `CUDA_CACHE_PATH=/root/.cache/nv-compute`
(the `CACHE_DIR` volume): `make prebuild` reports the count, and every later container, a new image's included, loads
them. A kernel compiles once per source and specialization (a changed kernel compiles on the first start that runs it).
Measured: boot 87 s -> 44 s (decode graphs 22.9 -> 11.2 s, warm-up 12.5 -> 3.7 s; calibration 24 s on a new
revision, 2 s cached), `make restart` 108 -> 71 s to serving.

## Updating

Sync the new source to `SRC` on the head, then `make image && make restart`. The image tag is a hash of the
Dockerfile and the source snapshot; `docker image ls tensorfold-dsv41` lists earlier builds for a rollback
(`TF_IMAGE=tensorfold-dsv41:<rev>` in `.env`).

## Hot source (Python changes without an image build)

    make hot     # SRC's src/ -> build/hot/src (both nodes), down, prebuild, up with docker-compose.hot.yaml
    make cold    # back to the image's own source (down, prebuild, up)

The image installs TensorFold editable (`pip install -e /opt/tensorfold`, whose `.pth` names `/opt/tensorfold/src`),
so `docker-compose.hot.yaml` mounts `build/hot/src` read-only over `/opt/tensorfold/src` and the container imports
the synced tree; nothing else in the image changes. While `build/hot/REVISION` exists every `up`, `restart`,
`prepare` and watchdog heal uses the override (`make status` says so); without it the compose commands are exactly the
image ones. `TF_REVISION=hot-<hash>` keeps per-image caches (the decode cost curves) apart; bytecode goes to
`/root/.cache/tensorfold-pycache`.

- CUDA extensions are still built into `CACHE_DIR` and keyed by their sources: a changed `.cu` compiles once, in the
  `prebuild` step `make hot` runs before the start (not beside a loaded model); unchanged ones load from the cache.
- A change to the code that builds the weights (`fastboot.CODE`) misses the prepared folder: starts build from the
  checkpoint (~82 s instead of ~24 s) until `make cold`. `make prepare` refuses while hot (`PREPARE_HOT=1` overrides):
  one folder fits on aiai's disk and it would replace the image's.
- `make image` remains the clean path: a pinned snapshot both nodes build, prebuilt and prepared. While hot source is
  still mounted it builds and prebuilds, then stops at `prepare` (exit 1): `make cold` first, or `PREPARE_HOT=1`.
- Measured 2026-10-05 (merged dsv41-cuda, extensions cached, prepared folders current): `make hot` 119 s from the
  command to serving (the server's own boot 89 s: weights 24 s, decode graphs 20 s, warm-up 12 s, calibration 25 s),
  `make cold` 117 s; `make image` after Python-only changes 10 s plus the same restart.
