"""DeepSeek-V4.1's concurrent rounds (``tensorfold serve --parallel N``): N streams in N cache slots, each round's rows
of every stream verified in one forward (``SerialEngine.step_multi``), so the weights a round reads serve them all.

Rows are row-invariant, so a stream's tokens equal its serial decoding however many streams share its rounds. Rank 0
decides (admissions, prefill steps, each stream's draft count, completions) and sends every decision to rank 1 before
acting on it; both ranks then compute the same tokens (argmax or position-keyed samples of the gathered logits).

The shared-pool extent lifecycle (``_make_room``, ``_grow``, ``_room``, ``_settle``, ``yield_for``: grow in place,
else move to a free run, else evict kept prompts; the newest replayable stream gives its rows back) and rank 0
sending ADMIT / EVICT / MOVE / GROW for rank 1 to apply follow ``glm5_next/cuda/multi.py`` of MiaAI-Lab's
GLM-5.3-Flash TensorFold recipe (patches 0030, 0040-0042; Apache License 2.0, Copyright 2026 MiaAI-Lab).
``_settle`` is adapted from its ``_settle``; the rest is rewritten for this engine (sid-keyed messages, the
fewest whole kept extents chosen up front, no compaction, NoRoom). See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
